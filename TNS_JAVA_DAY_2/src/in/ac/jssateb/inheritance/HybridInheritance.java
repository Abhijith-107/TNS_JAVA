HybridInheritance : [ multiple + Hierarchial ]
Since Java doesnâ€™t support multiple inheritances with classes, hybrid inheritance involving multiple inheritance
 is also not possible with classes
 
 we can achieve hybrid inheritance only through Interfaces if we want to involve multiple inheritance to implement 
 Hybrid inheritance
 
 public class SolarSystem {

public class Earth extends SolarSystem {
}
public class Mars extends SolarSystem {
}
public class Moon extends Earth {
}

Advantages Of Inheritance in Java:
1] Code Reusability
2] Abstraction
3] Class Hierarchy
4] Polymorphism
